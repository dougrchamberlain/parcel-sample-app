        <p>Sinister is rampant in the dev shop. Agile represents the future of software, a promise of
            productivity, yet hidden among the eager engineers are Nerlin's devious developers.
            These forces of Sinister are few in number but have knowledge of each other and
            remain hidden from all but one of the engineers. The Duke alone knows the agents of
            Sinister, but he must carefully hint at the truth. If his true identity is discovered all will
            be lost.
