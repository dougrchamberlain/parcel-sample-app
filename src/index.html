        <p> True Evil is rampant in the land. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and
            honor,
            yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous miniona.</p>
        <p> The forces of Evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one
            of
            Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of Evil, but he must speak of his only in riddles.If
            his
            true
            identity is discovered all will be lost.</p>

        <p>
            After all the players know their loyalty, the leader must ensure that all the Evil players know each
            other
            and
            that Merlin knows all the Evil players by repeating the following script:
